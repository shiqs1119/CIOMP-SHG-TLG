# Seoncd Harmonic Generation in Trilayer Graphene
These codes (fortran90) are used to calculate nonlinear optics coefficients of the second harmonic generation in trilayer graphene, which belongings to a research program in Changchun Insititue of Optics, Fine Mecahnics and Phycics, CAS(CIOMP)
##
More specifictly, there are some parameters describing the nonlinear optics process in the ABA trilayer graphene.
In this program, we set some parameters, numk for divide number , w for energy and gamma for the complex part of the frequency.Finally we get the conductivity and polarzation of the ABA stacked trilayer graphene.
